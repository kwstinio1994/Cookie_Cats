# Cookie Cats Player Engagement Analysis

## Description
This Streamlit application provides an in-depth analysis of player engagement in the mobile game Cookie Cats. The application delves into player retention, the number of game rounds played, and the variations in engagement across different game versions. 
The project involves data quality checks, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, predictive modeling, and visualization of results.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on our analysis of the Cookie Cats data, we have observed several key insights:

There is a statistically significant difference in 1-day and 7-day retention rates between the two game versions (gate_30 and gate_40).
The total number of game rounds played shows a wide distribution among players, indicating varied engagement levels.
The predictive model suggests that the number of game rounds played is a significant predictor of 7-day retention.
Recommendations:

Consider modifying game features in the version with lower retention rates to improve player engagement.
Focus on strategies to increase the total number of game rounds played by new players, as it correlates with higher retention.
Continue collecting and analyzing data to refine understanding of player behavior and preferences.
Please note that this analysis is exploratory and based on a limited dataset. It should be used as a starting point for deeper investigation and not as a definitive guide for game development decisions.
